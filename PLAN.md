<h1>Plan for Features in the Future</h1>
<h2>Account System</h2>
<h3><a href = "http://world.ac/test/account.php">account.php</a></h3> 

<h4>Email Confirmation System (1)</h4>
When a user signs up for an account, an email will be sent to their email confirming that they wanted to sign up; they can paste a code sent to their email to confirm the email.

<h4>Forgot Password System (2)</h4>
If the user forgets their password, they can reset it by sending an email to their preconfirmed email.

<h2>Navbar</h2>
<h3>navbar.php</h3> 
<h4>Make Notifications Bar Work (1)</h4>
Little Number that tells us how many notifcations (urgent ones) you have.

<h4>Fix Login/Register (2)</h4>
The element is too long, which double-stacks login/register on a screen res between 1080p and mobile

<h2>Scrollspy</h2>
<h3><a href = "http://world.ac/test/account.php">account.php</a>/<a href = "http://world.ac/faq.php">faq.php</a></h3> 
<h4>Fix/Implement Scrollspy</h4>
On all of the pages with another nav for body elements, it'd be nice to implement scrollspy. Right now, it doesn't work at all. Thoughts?
