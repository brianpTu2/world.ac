<h1>Plan for Features in the Future</h1>
Listed items are in relative order of importance/urgency. That being said, there are some quick fixes that can be done at any time.

<h2>Account System</h2>
<h3><a href = "http://world.ac/test/account.php">account.php</a></h3> 

<h4>Email Confirmation System (1)</h4>
When a user signs up for an account, an email will be sent to their email confirming that they wanted to sign up; they can paste a code sent to their email to confirm the email.

<h4>Forgot Password System (2)</h4>
If the user forgets their password, they can reset it by sending an email to their preconfirmed email.

<h2>Navbar</h2>
<h3>navbar.php</h3> 
<h4>Make Notifications Bar Work (1)</h4>
Little Number that tells us how many notifcations (urgent ones) you have.

<h4>Fix Login/Register (2)</h4>
The element is too long, which double-stacks login/register on a screen res between 1080p and mobile

<h2>Plenary Selection/Assignment</h2>
<h3>plen_Selection.php / <a href = "http://world.ac/test/account.php">account.php</a></h3>
<h4>Plenary Assignment (1)</h4>
Delegates not registering from UCC will have 4 preferred plenaries, in order of preference. We need to assign all of these delegates their plenaries, "optimally". Remember that UCC students also need to be included; while the framework of this system needs to be developed, we won't be legitmately running it until step 2 is done.


We had talked about using a "lotto" "first come first serve" system. Basically, we'd give 1st plenary preferences on a first registration basis until those run out; then we'd move on to 2nd preference, 3rd preference, etc.

<h4>Plenary Selection for UCC (2)</h4>
UCC students, since they aren't completing the reg-form, need to have a method of selecting their plenaries. We'll email them a link to a part of the WAC website where they input their UCC email, and select their plenaries of their choosing. We have two ways of doing this; doing it on account.php, or on another part of the website. 

<h2>Schedule</h2>
<h3>schedule.php</h3>
<h2>Schedule Page</h2>
Figure out some way of implementing a nice-looking schedule for the actual conference this year.


<h2>Media Distribution</h2>
<h3>Mostly Paper</h3>
<h2>Nametags</h2>
Delegates and staff will have a nametag with their name, plenaries (if applicable), school (delegates only), and staff position (if staff) printed on the card, as well as matching colours. We need to figure out a way to create the nametags without having to type through 2000 members. 



<h2>General Functionality</h2>
<h3><a href = "http://world.ac/test/account.php">account.php</a>/<a href = "http://world.ac/faq.php">faq.php</a></h3> 
<h4>Fix/Implement Scrollspy (1)</h4>
On all of the pages with another nav for body elements, it'd be nice to implement scrollspy. Right now, it doesn't work at all. Thoughts?
