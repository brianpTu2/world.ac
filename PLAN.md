# Plan for Features in the Future
Listed items are in relative order of importance/urgency. That being said, there are some quick fixes that can be done at any time.

##Account System
###<a href = "http://world.ac/test/account.php">account.php</a></h3> 

####Email Confirmation System (1)
When a user signs up for an account, an email will be sent to their email confirming that they wanted to sign up; they can paste a code sent to their email to confirm the email.

####Forgot Password System (2)
If the user forgets their password, they can reset it by sending an email to their preconfirmed email.

##Navbar
###navbar.php
####Make Notifications Bar Work (1)</h4>
Little Number that tells us how many notifcations (urgent ones) you have.

####Fix Login/Register (2)
The element is too long, which double-stacks login/register on a screen res between 1080p and mobile

##Plenary Selection/Assignment##
###plen_selection.php <a href = "http://world.ac/test/account.php">account.php</a>
####Plenary Assignment (1)
Delegates not registering from UCC will have 4 preferred plenaries, in order of preference. We need to assign all of these delegates their plenaries, "optimally". Remember that UCC students also need to be included; while the framework of this system needs to be developed, we won't be legitmately running it until step 2 is done.


We had talked about using a "lotto" "first come first serve" system. Basically, we'd give 1st plenary preferences on a first registration basis until those run out; then we'd move on to 2nd preference, 3rd preference, etc.

####Plenary Selection for UCC (2)
UCC students, since they aren't completing the reg-form, need to have a method of selecting their plenaries. We'll email them a link to a part of the WAC website where they input their UCC email, and select their plenaries of their choosing. We have two ways of doing this; doing it on account.php, or on another part of the website. 

##Schedule
###schedule.php
####Schedule Page
Figure out some way of implementing a nice-looking schedule for the actual conference this year.


##Media Distribution
###Mostly Paper
####Nametags
Delegates and staff will have a nametag with their name, plenaries (if applicable), school (delegates only), and staff position (if staff) printed on the card, as well as matching colours. We need to figure out a way to create the nametags without having to type through 2000 members. 



##General Functionality

####Fix/Implement Scrollspy (1)
On all of the pages with another nav for body elements, it'd be nice to implement scrollspy. Right now, it doesn't work at all. Thoughts?
