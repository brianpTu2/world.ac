/*
||| CSS FOR THE WAC WEBSITE |||
Few basic things:
Default font is Nexa, with an existing bold setting (no italics)
Links don't have an underline or change their colour.
Linking to a div tag links you to the place 100 px above where it actually is, to account for the navbar.
The navbar starts off expanded, and un-expands on scroll.
