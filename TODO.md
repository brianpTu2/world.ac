<h1>To-Do List</h1>
Jack this is for you
<h2>Account System</h2>
<h3><a href = "http://world.ac/test/account.php">account.php</a></h3> 
<h4>User Information (1)</h4>
Allow the user to view and edit their own info. This includes Basic information (School, Name), Special Notes, and eventually their password.
</br>
Make sure to tie this with the modal system. Most of, if not all of, the modals I've implemented don't send their inputs to the right place. Keep that in mind.
<h4>Notification System (2)</h4>
Display certain notifications based on information tied to the user.
</br>
Payment will be tied to a variable.
</br>
Email Confirmation is tied to completiton (so a variable).
</br>
Reg completition occurs when both of the above are met, AND a third boolean is true. This boolean should default to True, but can be manually set to be False.
</br>
Plenary Selection is a Boolean that Matt will edit later. Starts off as False.

<h4>Email Confirmation System (3)</h4>
When a user signs up for an account, an email will be sent to their email confirming that they wanted to sign up; they can paste a code sent to their email to confirm the email.

<h4>Forgot Password System (4)</h4>
If the user forgets their password, they can reset it by sending an email to their preconfirmed email.

<h2>About Us Page</h2>
<h3><a href = "http://world.ac/test/about_us.php">about_us.php</a></h3> 
<h4>Fix carousels</h4>
Stop the changing of the text size impacting the colour backgrounding. Stay on the page for a minute to understand what I mean.

<h2>Navbar</h2>
<h3>navbar.php</h3> 
<h4>Fix Login/Register</h4>
The element is too long, which double-stacks login/register on a screen res between 1080p and mobile

<h2>Scrollspy</h2>
<h3><a href = "http://world.ac/test/account.php">account.php</a><a href = "http://world.ac/faq.php">faq.php</a></h3> 
<h4>Fix/Implement Scrollspy</h4>
On all of the pages with another nav for body elements, it'd be nice to implement scrollspy. Right now, it doesn't work at all. Thoughts?
