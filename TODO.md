Jack this is for you
<h2>Account System</h2>
<h3><a href = "http://world.ac/test/account.php">account.php</a></h3> 
<h4>User Information (1)</h4>
Allow the user to view and edit their own info. This includes Basic information (School, Name), Special Notes, and eventually their password.
<h4>Notification System (2)</h4>
Display certain notifications based on information tied to the user.
</br>
Payment will be tied to a variable.
</br>
Email Confirmation is tied to completiton (so a variable).
</br>
Reg completition occurs when both of the above are met, AND a third boolean is true. This boolean should default to True, but can be manually set to be False.
</br>
Plenary Selection is a Boolean that Matt will edit later. Starts off as False.

<h4>Email Confirmation System (3)</h4>
When a user signs up for an account, an email will be sent to their email confirming that they wanted to sign up; they can click on a link to confirm their registration and account.
