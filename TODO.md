<h1>To-Do List</h1>
This is the priority of what needs to be done. Deadline for this list is Monday December 7th.
<h2>Account System</h2>
<h3><a href = "http://world.ac/test/account.php">account.php</a></h3> 
<h4>User Information (1)</h4>
Allow the user to view and edit their own info. This includes Basic information (School, Name), Special Notes, and eventually their password.
</br>
Make sure to tie this with the modal system. Most of, if not all of, the modals I've implemented don't send their inputs to the right place. Keep that in mind.
<h4>Notification System (2)</h4>
Display certain notifications based on information tied to the user.
</br>
Payment will be tied to a variable.
</br>
Email Confirmation is tied to completiton (so a variable).
</br>
Reg Competition also requires you to finish inputting your school/special notes.
</br>
Plenary Selection is a Boolean that Matt will edit later. Starts off as False.
