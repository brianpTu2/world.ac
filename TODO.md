#To-Do List
This is the priority of what needs to be done. Deadline for this list is Monday December 7th.
##Cleaning up and migration
The current codebase in test is horrible. No orginization whatsoever, minimal (and sometime wrong) comments, and multiple orphaned files. Please clean it up.
##Account System
### [account.php](http://world.ac/test/account.php)
####Notification System (1)
* Display certain notifications based on information tied to the user.
* Payment will be tied to a variable.
* Email Confirmation is tied to completiton (so a variable).
* Reg Competition also requires you to finish inputting your school/special notes.
* Plenary Selection is a Boolean that Matt will edit later. Starts off as False.
