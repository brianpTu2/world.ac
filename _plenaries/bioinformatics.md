shortbio: "In the future, your eye could be scanned when you walk into work, your genetic makeup could be the passcode that lets you into your computer, or a hair from your head could let doctors know exactly what illnesses you get. Should we be able to have access to this information?"

In the world today, jobs have become increasingly run by technology. This could mean that you having your eye scanned when you walk into work, or that your genetic makeup is the passcode that lets you into your computer. It could even mean that doctors will know exactly what illnesses you'll get, thanks to just a hair from your head. But having access to this information is controversial. Should we be able to have access to this information? Should we be using this data in our everyday lives, let alone the job market? Should this topic even be ethically explored? And, who else will get access to our information? There are many benefits to having this information, including being able to save lives with genetics, but the drawbacks include an intrusion of privacy and many more. Itâ€™s up to you to decide where you stand on the line.
