The importance of achieving a model for sustainable development and energy production stems from the rapid growth of human population coupled by a culture focused too heavily on excessive goods, sourced though unsustainable means. Our actions are expediting natural processes, leading the future of our planet as we know it, down an ever dark path. As citizens of this world, it is our responsibility to find a sustainable process that can be maintained, or as the Brutland Report famously says, “meets the needs and aspirations of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. This panel explores the several implications of this problem and practically innovative solutions that have been put forth to help combat this cause.
