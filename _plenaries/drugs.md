After decades of speculation and justifiable anxiety about the implications for humankind, the era of artificial intelligence is finally here. In this plenary, speakers will identify what they believe to be the future of AI, discussing the impacts of artificial intelligence on business, government policy and the ethics of it all. Artificial Intelligence has been called the defining revolution of our generation, but with every breakthrough, there emerges concerns that must be addressed and analyzed through every lens.
