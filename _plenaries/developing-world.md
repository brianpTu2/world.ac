This plenary will look at how technology can help developing countries and how it can hinder more developed nations. Speakers in this plenary will discuss how technology can decrease quality of education and make it harder for students to learn as well as talking about the potential technology brings to countries who are in dire need of improvement to some of the most basic human rights. This balance should provide students with a unique opportunity to broaden their horizons by learning about how technology impacts the rest of the world, while also bringing up a topic that it is relevant to their current and near future experiences in high school or post-secondary education.
