This plenary will look at how technology can help developing countries and hinder more developed nations. Speakers in this plenary will discuss the comparative between these two different situations: how technology can decrease quality of education and make it harder for students to learn, as well as the potential technology brings to countries to improve basic human rights. This balance should provide students with a unique opportunity to broaden their horizons by learning about how technology impacts the rest of the world, while also bringing up a topic that is relevant to their current and near future experiences in high school or post-secondary education.
