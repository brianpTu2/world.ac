Greetings! My name is John and i'll be filling you in on the on-going web development of the 2017 World Affairs Conference. WAC is a massive student-lead (and faculty advised) event spanning one full day within the month of April. 

The WAC website is equally detailed and intricate as the conference itself. With roughly ten developers in departments such as web design, registration processing, server administration and testing WAC is truly a massive collection of talented individuals working towards something incredible.
