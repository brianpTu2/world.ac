## The WAC Blog

The WAC Blog aims to keep delegates updated about the conference, with details such as registration, conference information, and delegate inquiries. In addition, it aims to provide insight into the hundreds of hours WAC staff put in into making the conference as engaging as it can possibly be, whether it be media creation, computer science, or planning.

Updates will be posted by different authors from different departments of WAC, including conference chairs, department heads, plenary heads, and staff from all of WAC.

## The World Affairs Conference

The World Affairs Conference (WAC) is Canada's oldest annual student-run current affairs conference. Annually held at Upper Canada College in Toronto, Canada, the World Affairs Conference connects over 1000 students, with a common interest in current affairs, from across North America. A dedicated team of about 100 high school students from Upper Canada College, in coordination with Branksome Hall, voluntarily contribute their time for many months leading up to the day of WAC to ensure the success and positive experience for each delegate that attends the conference. We look forward to welcoming you to the 2017 conference.
