    <p class="text">A dedicated team of about 100 high school students from Upper Canada College, in coordination with Branksome Hall, voluntarily contribute their time for many months leading up to the day of WAC to ensure the success and positive experience for each delegate that attends the conference. We look forward to welcoming you to the 2017 conference.</p>
