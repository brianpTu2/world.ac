Hi! I'm Matt, one of the Heads of Registration/Media and the Head of Technology for WAC. I'm excited to bring to you the WAC blog, a first for the World Affairs Conference. In conjunction with the rest of the blog, I hope to update you guys with information about the conference, as well as the work that we've put in into making the conference awesome!

I quickly want to talk about why we even have a WAC blog in the first place. In the age where we get more news from Twitter, Reddit, and BuzzFeed compared to the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and the Toronto Star, WAC needs to keep up to allow the conference to be engaging towards its delegates. Furthermore, previous iterations of WAC have had very active engagement between the conference and its delegates **before** the conference. With the blog, we hopefully are able to connect more with delegates, and provide a more wholesome, 21st-Century oriented conference view.

If you're interested in how the blog, or the website is made, you can check out [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/malsf21/world.ac). In addition, we'll be posting updates about the technology that powers WAC.

Thanks for reading, and welcome to WAC!
