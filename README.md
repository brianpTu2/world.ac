### Quick Pointers

* Our production-ready version of the website is stored in `stable`, which is available for viewing at [world.ac](http://world.ac).
* Our testing-but-stable version of the website is stored in `master`, which is available for viewing on [my webserver](http://matthewwang.me/wac).
* All other branches are not officially available on the web. Instead, you'll have to build and run them yourself. Refer to our setup section for more information.

### Notes for the Media Department/Website Sub-Department

It's been a good year, but we're going to have to go at it again. Next year's WAC is going to happen, and unlike this year, we want to be ahead of the game. A few key things:
* Layout is almost done, and should be done by the time general conference vision is completed (**early September**)
* We will be using **Bootstrap 4** as our CSS framework.
* We are using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static site pages.
* Online Registration is **confirmed**. This would be our #1 priority after the structure/layout of the site is finished.
* The account system this year will only concern **faculty advisers** and **independent students**.
* A majority of Media's job in the upcoming year is creating a strong media foundation, especially artistically. The artistic theme of the website is **not finalized yet**, and will be decided in conjunction with media.
