<h1>world.ac</h1>
Here's the repository for <a href ="http://world.ac">world.ac</a> </br>

We use the <a href = "http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap Framework</a> for a lot of the site.

<h2>To-Do:</h2>
<h3>Main Project</h3>
The main project is the current big undertaking. Please work on this project in the /test directory.
</br>
Account System. This includes:
</br>
<a href = "http://world.ac/test">Account Page</a> (Ability to Log in, and display info from a spreadsheet. Allow user to edit spreadsheet info) [Skeleton Formatting Done]
</br>
<a href = "http://world.ac/test">Account Navbar functionality</a> (log in from navbar, quick avatar, display link to acc page. Changes whether or not the user is logged in)  [Skeleton Formatting Done]
</br>

<h3>Side Projects</h3>
Side projects. Please do not work on these projects in the /test directory. 
</br>
Create bootstrap compatible pages for <a href = "http://world.ac/keynote.php">Keynote Speaker</a>, Opening/Closing Panels, and Schedule 
</br>
Fix <a href = "http://world.ac/faq">FAQ Page</a> (mobile compat + div links not working correctly) + implement <a href = "http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy">scrollspy</a> 
</br>
Plenary Selection Mechansim (for UCC, select plenaries) 
</br>
Static footer 
</br>
Headshot images! (and maybe format fixing for mobile devices) 
</br>



<h2>Etiquette</h2>
<h3>Files</h3>
Please put all files in their respective folders (i.e. images in /img). 
</br>
Test projects should not be pushed into the live website; instead, they should be either pushed to a different branch, the /test folder (this one typically holds the big, current to-do task), or a test_FILENAME version.
</br>
Multi-word filenames should use an underscore, such as multi_word_filename.js

<h3>Coding</h3>
All viewable pages need to be .php files.
</br>
Please reference navbar.php/footer.php in every user-based page. In addition, please remember to import all of the correct JavaScript and CSS files.
</br>
Please keep mobile viewability in mind. Bootstrap is a specialized mobile framework. Often, this means using <a href = "http://getbootstrap.com/components/">Bootstrap-created elements</a>, which scale with <a href = "http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities">mobile resolutions</a>. 

<h3>Convention</h3>
Please try your best to comment relatively thoroughly on big commits. One big comment, followed by several nonchalant comments is fine.
</br>
Please sync/pull the latest changes BEFORE starting coding. In addition, please push all changes made on the webserver to the github repo (git push origin master/git push devel master).
</br>
After a completely new functionality is fully implemented and added, please do not destabilize it. Wait for a release to be published before moving onto the next project.
