<h2>Etiquette</h2>
<h3>Files</h3>
Please put all files in their respective folders (i.e. images in /img). 
</br>
Test projects should not be pushed into the live website; instead, they should be either pushed to a different branch, the /test folder (this one typically holds the big, current to-do task), or a test_FILENAME version.
</br>
Multi-word filenames should use an underscore, such as multi_word_filename.js

<h3>Coding</h3>
All viewable pages need to be .php files.
</br>
Please reference navbar.php/footer.php in every user-based page. In addition, please remember to import all of the correct JavaScript and CSS files.
</br>
Please keep mobile viewability in mind. Bootstrap is a specialized mobile framework. Often, this means using <a href = "http://getbootstrap.com/components/">Bootstrap-created elements</a>, which scale with <a href = "http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities">mobile resolutions</a>. 

<h3>Convention</h3>
Please try your best to comment relatively thoroughly on big commits. One big comment, followed by several nonchalant comments is fine.
</br>
Please sync/pull the latest changes BEFORE starting coding. In addition, please push all changes made on the webserver to the github repo (git push origin master/git push devel master).
</br>
After a completely new functionality is fully implemented and added, please do not destabilize it. Wait for a release to be published before moving onto the next project.
