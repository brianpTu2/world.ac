# world.ac
Here's the repository for the world.ac website.

We use the Bootstrap framework (getbootstrap.com) for a lot of the site. 

Quick tips:
1. Test code should either be in a separate branch or done on a test (with an _ for non index pages) page instead of being directly pushed </br>
2. Please put all images in the /img directory </br>
3. Please put all js and css in their respective directories </br>
4. All viewable pages should be .php files </br>
5. Please import navbar.php and footer.php for the nav and footer for every page </br>
6. Remember to import all the css required (custom.css + both bootstrap files)  </br>
7. Reference base.css if you can, especially for styles across multiple pages </br>
8. Please keep mobile design in mind, try to use bootstrap's responsive utilities.  </br>
9. Optimally use php scripts, as they load quicker on mobile and desktop viewports. Js is fine if its neeeded. </br>
10. Before making any major changes (typically pushing any changes to the live site), please contact Matthew Wang. </br>
