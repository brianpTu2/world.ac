# world.ac
Here's the repository for the world.ac website.

We use the Bootstrap framework (getbootstrap.com) for a lot of the site. 

Quick tips:
1. Test code should either be in a separate branch or done on a test (with an _ for non index pages) page instead of being directly pushed
2. Please put all images in the /img directory
3. Please put all js and css in their respective directories
4. All viewable pages should be .php files
5. Please import navbar.php and footer.php for the nav and footer for every page
6. Remember to import all the css required (custom.css + both bootstrap files) 
7. Reference base.css if you can, especially for styles across multiple pages
8. Please keep mobile design in mind, try to use bootstrap's responsive utilities. 
9. Optimally use php scripts, as they load quicker on mobile and desktop viewports. Js is fine if its neeeded.
10. Before making any major changes (typically pushing any changes to the live site), please contact Matthew Wang.
