## Welcome Back

It's been a good year, but we're going to have to go at it again. Next year's WAC is going to happen, and unlike this year, we want to be ahead of the game. A few key things:
* Layout should be done by the time general conference vision is finished (this is typically **early September**)
* The possibility of online reg is definitely on the table (and imo is a great idea). If it gets passed, it becomes our #1 priority (we'll get this information **late May/early June**)
* We will switch from Bootstrap 3 to **Bootstrap 4**, only if we get a stable release by ** late August/early September **. If not, we'll stick with Bootstrap 3.3.6
* The account system, in it's current form, needs to be either **scrapped** or **heavily reworked**. I will update you guys more on it after we get reg info.
* A majority of Media's job in the upcoming year is creating a strong media foundation, especially artistically. The artistic theme of the website is **not finalized yet**, and will be decided in conjunction with media.
