      bio: Zachary Manchester is a Ph.D. graduate and researcher in aerospace engineering. He is the founder of “Kicksat”, a service that aims to allow any civilian to put a small satellite into orbit on the scale of a few hundred dollars. The purpose of this is to put space exploration in the hands of anyone who is interested as opposed to being exclusively owned by scientists, engineers, and astronauts. Currently, he develops optimization-based algorithms for robust control and system identification with applications to agile flight of small wing-morphing aircrafts at Harvard University.

  title: The one about the internet
  blurb: |
   The Internet has radically revolutionized the entire world. Everything from how we shop to how we vote has been affected by the Internet. As a result, the Internet continues to proliferate in every facet. This exponential growth will have huge ramifications on both governments and individuals. Governments have both had an increased security due to the internet, with an increasingly pervasive method of gathering information on one's citizens, increasing security. Oppressive regimes have abused the internet in order to exert control, while advocates for terrorism have begun utilizing the internet as a powerful tool to propagate their cause. However, citizens have used the Internet as tool to unite and learn. The Arab Spring saw a wave of protests and revolution based off of Internet usage­­­specifically social media. Meanwhile citizens in democracies have discovered their right to privacy has been stripped, as their governments use their tools for finding terrorists against their own citizens.  As the Internet affects many different aspects of everyday life, each panelist will have a specific viewpoint and frame of reference on the Internet, and will help outline the benefits of, and issues with, the Internet's proliferation. Moreover, they will explain and debate their solutions to those problems.
